    "dc_description_s": "In late 1996, the Dept of Conservation (DOC) surveyed state and federal agencies about the county boundary coverage they used. As a result, DOC adopted the 1:24,000 (24K) scale U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) dataset (USGS source) for their Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) but with several modifications. Detailed documentation of these changes is provided by FMMP and included in the lineage section of the metadata.  A dataset named cnty24k97_1 was made available (approximately 2004) through the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection - Fire and Resource Assessment Program (CDF - FRAP) and the California Spatial Information Library (CaSIL).\n\nIn late 2006, the Department of Fish and Game (DFG) reviewed cnty24k97_1.  Comparisons were made to a high-quality 100K dataset (co100a/county100k from the former Teale Data Center GIS Solutions Group) and legal boundary descriptions from ( http://www.leginfo.ca.gov ).  The cnty24k97_1 dataset was missing Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands.  DFG added the missing islands using previously-digitized coastline data (coastn27 of State Lands Commission origin), corrected a few county boundaries, built region topology, added additional attributes, and renamed the dataset to county24k.\n\nIn 2007, the California Mapping Coordinating Committee (CMCC) requested that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) resume stewardship of the statewide county boundaries data.  CAL FIRE adopted the changes made by DFG and collected additional suggestions for the county data from DFG, DOC, and local government agencies.  CAL FIRE incorporated these suggestions into the latest revision, which has been renamed cnty24k09_1.  Detailed documentation of changes is included in the Process Step section of the metadata.",

    "dc_description_s": "The polygons in this datalayer represent U.S. Census Blocks for the entire state. Census blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Generally census blocks are small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas may be large and irregular and contain hundreds of square miles. All territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas have block numbers. Blocks are composed of one or more GT-polygons; that is, several GT-polygons can share the same block number.\n\nCensus 2000 Block Numbers.\nCensus 2000 tabulation blocks are numbered uniquely within each state/county/census tract with a four-digit census block number. The U.S. Census Bureau created the tabulation block numbers immediately before beginning its Census 2000 data tabulation process, thereby eliminating block suffixes. The first digit of the tabulation block number identifies the block group. For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned a unique 1990 block number with a suffix of \"Z\" to identify crews-of-vessels population. For Census 2000, crews-of-vessels population is assigned to the land block identified by the U.S. Census Bureau as associated with the home port of the vessel.\n\nWater Blocks.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau introduced a different method for identifying the water areas of census blocks for Census 2000. For the 1990 census, water was not uniquely identified within a census block; instead, all water area internal to a block group was given a single block number ending in \"99\" (for example, in block group 1, all water was identified as block 199). A suffix was added to each 1990 water block number where the block existed in more than one tabulation entity within its block group. For Census 2000, water area located completely within the boundary of a single land block has the same block number as that land block. Water area that touches more than one land block is assigned a unique block number not associated with any adjacent land block. The U.S. Census Bureau assigned water block numbers beginning with the block group number followed by \"999 \" and preceding in descending order. For example, in block group 3, the block numbers assigned to water areas that border multiple land blocks are 3999, 3998, 3997, and so forth. Because some land blocks include water (ponds and small lakes), no conclusions about whether or not a block is all land or all water can be made by looking at the Census 2000 block numbers. Data users must use the WATER field on Record Type S to determine if the GT-polygon is land or water. The WATER field has two values, 0 for land or 1 for water.",

    "dc_description_s": "The polygons represent Congressional Districts for the state based on the congressional districts in effect at the time of Census 2000, which are those of the 106th Congress, whose session began in January 1999. \n\nCongressional districts are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of electing representatives. Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable. \n\nThe congressional districts for the 103rd Congress (January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. The 103rd Congressional Districts will remain in effect through Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting required a change. Six states redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), five states redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states (New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. \n\nIn North Carolina the \"1998 Congressional Plan A\" was used for the 1998 congressional elections. It was created in response to a court ruling which held the 1997 plan, \"97 House/Senate Plan A,\" unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has since reversed that lower court ruling and was used for the 2000 North Carolina congressional elections. The 106th Congressional Districts appearing in the UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files for North Carolina are the \"97 House/Senate Plan A\" Congressional Districts. The 108th Congress will be the first to reflect reapportionment and redistricting based on Census 2000 data. Congressional districts are identified by a 2-character numeric FIPS code.\n\nThe UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files contain fields for the current (106th ), the 106th, and the 108th Congressional Districts. Congressional districts are numbered uniquely within state. The field for the 108th Congressional Districts is blank. The current congressional district field always has a value other than blank for all polygons.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays County Subdivisions (Minor Civil Divisions) for the state, based on legal and statistical entities established on January 1, 2000. County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their statistical equivalents for the reporting of decennial census data. They include: Census County Divisions; Census Sub-areas; Minor Civil Divisions, and Unorganized Territories. The TIGER/Line files contain a 5-character numeric FIPS code field for county subdivisions. The Census Bureau has established Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs) for Michigan.\n\nLegal Entities:\n\nMinor Civil Divisions (MCDs)\nMCDs are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states. MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. MCDs are variously designated as American Indian reservations, assessment districts, boroughs, election districts, gores, grants, locations, magisterial districts, parish governing authority districts, plantations, precincts, purchases, road districts, supervisor's districts, towns, and townships. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in 28 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and the District of Columbia is considered equivalent to an MCD for statistical purposes. \n- In some states, all or some incorporated places are not part of any MCD. These places also serve as primary legal subdivisions and have a unique FIPS MCD code that is the same as the FIPS place code. The TIGER/ Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the county subdivision field and the place field. In other states, incorporated places are part of the MCDs in which they are located, or the pattern is mixed; some incorporated places are independent of MCDs and others are included within one or more MCDs.\n- The MCDs in 12 states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places. The U.S. Census Bureau presents data for these MCDs in all data products in which it provides data for places.\n- In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as the statistical equivalent of MCDs for purposes of data presentation.\n\nStatistical Entities:\n\nCensus County Divisions (CCDs)\nCCDs are areas delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with state officials and local officials for statistical purposes. CCDs have no legal function and are not governmental units. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and in most cases, coincide with census tract boundaries. The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location. CCDs exist where:\n1) There are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs).\n2) The legally established MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes.\n3) The boundaries of the MCDs change frequently.\n4) The MCDs are not generally known to the public.\n\nCensus Subareas\nCensus subareas are statistical subdivisions of boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and census areas, the statistical equivalent entities for counties in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau cooperatively delineate the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs. Census subareas were first used in the 1980 census.\n\nUnorganized Territories (UTs)\nThe U.S. Census Bureau defines unorganized territories in 10 minor civil division (MCD) states where portions of counties are not included in any legally established MCD or incorporated place. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes such separate pieces of territory as one or more separate county subdivisions for census purposes. It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name, followed by the designation \"unorganized territory\" and a county subdivision code. Unorganized territories were first reported in the 1960 census. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns a default county subdivision code of 00000 in some coastal and Great Lakes water where county subdivisions do not extend into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Key Geographic Locations (KGLs), as defined by the US Census Bureau, throughout the state. Essential attribute data included are KGL Name and Census Feature Class Code (CFCC). Predominant features represented in this layer include: Airports or airfields; Custodial Facility (hospital, orphanage, Federal penitentiary, state prison); Educational or Religious Institution (convent or monastery, educational institution, religious institution); Multihousehold or Transient Quarters (apartment buildings and complexes, trailer courts or mobile home parks, campground, hotels, motels); Shopping centers or major retail centers; Transportation Terminal (train station, bus or marine terminal).\n\nPlease note that many other feature types may be present in this layer. Key geographic locations (KGLs) represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty.\n\nThe Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration.\n\n A landmark can be a point, line, or area type. In some cases, the Census TIGER data base permits a choice of types. For instance, an airport or airfield might appear as a point, line, or area; the approach depends on the size of the feature and the depiction of the feature in the source document. Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types\n\nA census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category.\n\nLandmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location. A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays the Type A class roads thoughout the state.\nFeature Class A roads include: Primary roads with limited access (interstate highways, toll highways); Primary roads without limited access (US highways, some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns); regional and state highways state highways, Secondary and connecting roads (includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods); Local, neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, and vehicular trails.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER database as two distinct complete chains. The term, rail line in center, indicates that a rail line shares the road right-of-way. The rail line may follow the center of the road or be directly next to the road; representation is dependent upon the available source used during the update. The rail line can represent a railroad, a streetcar line, or other carline. Road types possibly represented here are defined as follows:\n\n-Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.\n-Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics.\n-Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways.\n-Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads.\n-Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in this category.\n-Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics.\n-Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.",

CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions.

    "dc_description_s": "The polygons in this datalayer represent U.S. Census Blocks for the entire state. Census blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Generally census blocks are small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas may be large and irregular and contain hundreds of square miles. All territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas have block numbers. Blocks are composed of one or more GT-polygons; that is, several GT-polygons can share the same block number.\n\nCensus 2000 Block Numbers.\nCensus 2000 tabulation blocks are numbered uniquely within each state/county/census tract with a four-digit census block number. The U.S. Census Bureau created the tabulation block numbers immediately before beginning its Census 2000 data tabulation process, thereby eliminating block suffixes. The first digit of the tabulation block number identifies the block group. For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned a unique 1990 block number with a suffix of \"Z\" to identify crews-of-vessels population. For Census 2000, crews-of-vessels population is assigned to the land block identified by the U.S. Census Bureau as associated with the home port of the vessel.\n\nWater Blocks.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau introduced a different method for identifying the water areas of census blocks for Census 2000. For the 1990 census, water was not uniquely identified within a census block; instead, all water area internal to a block group was given a single block number ending in \"99\" (for example, in block group 1, all water was identified as block 199). A suffix was added to each 1990 water block number where the block existed in more than one tabulation entity within its block group. For Census 2000, water area located completely within the boundary of a single land block has the same block number as that land block. Water area that touches more than one land block is assigned a unique block number not associated with any adjacent land block. The U.S. Census Bureau assigned water block numbers beginning with the block group number followed by \"999 \" and preceding in descending order. For example, in block group 3, the block numbers assigned to water areas that border multiple land blocks are 3999, 3998, 3997, and so forth. Because some land blocks include water (ponds and small lakes), no conclusions about whether or not a block is all land or all water can be made by looking at the Census 2000 block numbers. Data users must use the WATER field on Record Type S to determine if the GT-polygon is land or water. The WATER field has two values, 0 for land or 1 for water.",

Block Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract having the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number.  For example, block group 3 (BG 3) within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from 3000 to 3999. \n\nCensus 2000 BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the U.S. Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant.\n\nA BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urbanized areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian/Alaska Native areas/Hawaiian home lands. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian homeland census geographic hierarchy, census tracts and BGs are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as Tribal BGs.\n\nBGs have a valid range of 0 through 9. BGs beginning with a 0 generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three mile territorial sea limit, the U.S. Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The U.S. Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0000 and BG of 0 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.\n\nIn decennial census data tabulations, a block group may be split to present data for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, voting district, congressional district, American Indian area/Alaska Native area/ Hawaiian home land shown in the data tabulation products.",

A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.\nThe predominant feature classes represented in this layer include airports or airfields, cemeteries, fraternities or sororities, state or local parks or forests, golf courses, lookout towers, educational and religious institutions.  Other possible landmark features could include military installations, multi-household or transient quarters, custodial facilities, other types of transportation facilities or terminals, employment centers, open space and other special landmark designations for post offices, police stations and firehouses.\n\nThe Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration.\n\nA census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category.\n\nLandmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location.",

The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files contain school district information from the 1999-2000 school year.\n\nThe UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files identify three levels of school districts representing different grade ranges of the school-age population (elementary and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represent all grade levels. The elementary and secondary levels of a school district can overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, a secondary school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The TIGER/Line files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files contain a Unified School District code for those school districts where all grade levels are represented in a single district. The elementary and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code. An exception exists for the State of Hawaii and the five boroughs of New York city where the National School District Program requested that the U.S. Census Bureau include the School Complex Areas in Hawaii and the Community School Districts in New York city. In Massachusetts. South Carolina, and Tennessee some unified school districts also serve as secondary school districts in areas where there are elementary school districts. In these situations, the U.S. Census Bureau could not use the same school district code to identify school districts serving different grade ranges and has assigned two separate codes; a unified school district code and a separate \"false\" secondary school district code. Data users can identify the \"false\" school districts by looking for \"false\" as part of the school district name appearing in Record Type C. A few additional exceptions occur where the Department of Defense operates elementary schools within a unified school district.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files store the school district codes in a set of three, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 99999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district. Some large water areas have a pseudo-school district code of 99998.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays the Urbanized Areas (UAs) for the state based on a January 1, 2000 ground condition. Note that the Census Bureau made significant changes in Urban/Rural designations for the Census 2000 data layers.  Some of these delineations and definitions are explained below.\n\nFor Census 2000 the U.S. Census Bureau classifies as urban all territory, population, and housing units located within urbanized areas (UAs) and urban clusters (UCs). It delineates UA and UC boundaries to encompass densely settled territory, which generally consists of: \n- A cluster of one or more block groups or census blocks each of which has a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile at the time\n- Surrounding block groups and census blocks each of which has a population density of at least 500 people per square mile at the time, and\n- Less densely settled blocks that form enclaves or indentations, or are used to connect discontiguous areas with qualifying densities.\n\nRural consists of all territory, population, and housing units located outside of UAs and UCs. For Census 2000 this urban and rural classification applies to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.\n\nUrbanized Areas (UAs)\nAn urbanized area consists of densely settled territory that contains 50,000 or more people. The U.S. Census Bureau delineates UAs to provide a better separation of urban and rural territory, population, and housing in the vicinity of large places. For Census 2000, the UA criteria were extensively revised and the delineations were performed using a zero-based approach. Because of more stringent density requirements, some territory that was classified as urbanized for the 1990 census has been reclassified as rural. (Area that was part of a 1990 UA has not been automatically grandfathered into the 2000 UA.) In addition, some areas that were identified as UAs for the 1990 census have been reclassified as urban clusters.\n\nUrban Clusters (UCs)\nAn urban cluster consists of densely settled territory that has at least 2,500 people but fewer than 50,000 people. The U.S. Census Bureau introduced the UC for Census 2000 to provide a more consistent and accurate measure of the population concentration in and around places. UCs are defined using the same criteria that are used to define UAs. UCs replace the provision in the 1990 and previous censuses that defined as urban only those places with 2,500 or more people located outside of urbanized areas.\n\nUrban Area Title and Code\nThe title of each UA and UC may contain up to three incorporated place names, and will include the two-letter U.S. Postal Service abbreviation for each state into which the UA or UC extends. However, if the UA or UC does not contain an incorporated place, the urban area title will include the single name of a census designated place (CDP), minor civil division, or populated place recognized by the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System. Each UC and UA is assigned a 5-digit numeric code, based on a national alphabetical sequence of all urban area names. For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned as four-digit UA code based on the metropolitan area codes. \n\nUrban Area Central Places\nA central place functions as the dominant center of an urban area. The U.S. Census Bureau identifies one or more central places for each UA or UC that contains a place. Any incorporated place or census designated place (CDP) that is in the title of the urban area is a central place of that UA or UC. In addition, any other incorporated place or CDP that has an urban population of 50,000 or an urban\npopulation of at least 2,500 people and is at least 2/3 the size of the largest place within the urban area also is a central place.\n\nExtended Places\nAs a result of the UA and UC delineations, an incorporated place or census designated place (CDP) may be partially within and partially outside of a UA or UC. Any place that is split by a UA or UC is referred to as an extended place.\n\n1990 Urban/Rural \nThe U.S. Census Bureau defined urban for the 1990 census as consisting of all territory and population in urbanized areas (UAs) and in the urban portion of places with 2,500 or more people located outside of the UAs. The 1990 urban and rural classification applied to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n\n1990 Urbanized Areas \nA 1990 urbanized area (UA) consisted of at least one central place and the adjacent densely settled surrounding territory that together had a minimum population of 50,000 people. The densely settled surrounding territory generally consisted of an area with continuous residential development and a general overall population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile.\n\n1990 Extended Cities \nFor the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau distinguished the urban and rural population within incorporated places whose boundaries contained large, sparsely populated, or even unpopulated area. Under the 1990 criteria, an extended city had to contain either 25 percent of the total land area or at least 25 square miles with an overall population density lower than 100 people per square mile. Such pieces of territory had to cover at least 5 square miles. This low-density area was classified as rural and the other, more densely settled portion of the incorporated place was classified as urban. Unlike previous censuses where the U.S. Census Bureau defined extended cities only within UAs, for the 1990 census the U.S. Census Bureau applied the extended city criteria to qualifying incorporated places located outside UAs.\n\n1990 Urbanized Area Codes \nEach 1990 UA was assigned a 4-digit numeric census code in alphabetical sequence on a nationwide basis based on the metropolitan area codes. Note that in Record Type C, the 1990 UA 4-digit numeric census code and Census 2000 UA 5-digit numeric census code share a 5-character field. Because of this, the 1990 4-digit UA code, in Record Type C only, appears with a trailing blank.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the state of Alaska. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs).\n\nCensus tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement, delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. \nCensus tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties (see TRIBAL CENSUS TRACTS). The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays the Type A class roads thoughout the state.\nFeature Class A roads include: Primary roads with limited access (interstate highways, toll highways); Primary roads without limited access (US highways, some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns); regional and state highways state highways, Secondary and connecting roads (includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods); Local, neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, and vehicular trails.\n\nAccording to the TIGER95 Data Dictionary, the definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having, \"..opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas.\" This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update.\n\nRoad types possibly represented here are defined as follows:\n\n-Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.\n-Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics.\n-Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways.\n-Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads.\n-Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in category\n-Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics.\n-Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer depicts feature location and other associated data for American Indian tribal entities for those entities established on January 1, 1990. American Indian Reservations are areas that have been set aside by the United States for the use of tribes, the exterior boundaries of which are more particularly defined in the final tribal treaties, agreements, executive orders, federal statutes, secretarial orders, or judicial determinations. The Census Class Code range associated with American Indian Reservations is 0001 to 4989 for the 1990 datalayer.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau recognizes federal reservations as territory over which American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority. These entities are known as colonies, communities, pueblos, rancherias, ranches, reservations, reserves, villages, Indian communities, and Indian villages. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) maintains a list of federally recognized tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau contacts representatives of American Indian tribal governments to identify the boundaries for federal reservations. Federal reservations may cross state, county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. The BIA supplied the U.S. Census Bureau with the names and exterior boundaries of the federal AIRs used for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for American Indian reservations in the 1970 census.\nThere are both legal and statistical American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides data. The legal entities consist of federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, the tribal subdivisions that can divide these entities, state recognized American Indian reservations, Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs), and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs). Tribal subdivisions can exist within the statistical Oklahoma tribal statistical areas. In all cases, these areas are mutually exclusive in that no American Indian, Alaska Native, or Hawaiian home land can overlap another tribal entity, except for tribal subdivisions, which subdivide some American Indian entities, and Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), which exist within Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs). \n\nAmerican Indian Trust Lands\nAreas for which the United States holds title in trust for the benefit of a tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual Indian (individual trust land). Trust lands can be alienated or encumbered only by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his/her authorized representative. Trust lands may be located on or off a reservation. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data for reservations and off-reservation trust lands because American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority over these lands. Primary tribal governmental authority generally is not attached to tribal lands located off the reservation until the lands are placed in trust. In U.S. Census Bureau data tabulations, off-reservation trust lands always are associated with a specific federally recognized reservation and/or tribal government. A tribal government appointed liaison provides the name and boundaries of their trust lands. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), an agency in the U.S. Department of the Interior, identified and provided maps of these areas for use by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for off-reservation tribal trust lands in the 1980 census; in 1990, the trust land data included both tribal and individual trust lands. The U.S. Census Bureau does not identify fee land (or land in fee simple status) or restricted fee lands as specific geographic categories and they are not identified in the TIGER/Line files. Trust lands are assigned the same code as the reservation with which they are associated. Trust lands associated with tribes that do not have a reservation are assigned codes based on tribal name. In the TIGER/Line files, a letter code-\"T\" for tribal and \"I\" for individual-appears in a separate field and identifies off-reservation trust lands.\n\nAmerican Indian Reservations-State (State AIRs) \nReservations established by some state governments for tribes recognized by the state. A governor-appointed state liaison provides the names and boundaries for state recognized American Indian reservations to the U.S. Census Bureau. State reservations may cross county, county subdivision, and place boundaries.\n\nAmerican Indian Tribal Subdivisions\nAdministrative subdivisions of federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust land, or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs). Tribal subdivisions are known as areas, chapters, communities, or districts. These entities are internal units of self-government or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for the American Indians on the reservations, off-reservation trust lands, or OTSAs. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundary and name information for tribal subdivisions from tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in 1980 when it identified them as \"American Indian sub-reservation areas.\" The U.S. Census Bureau did not provide data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in conjunction with the 1990 census.\n\nJoint Use Areas\nAs applied to any American Indian area/Alaska Native area by the U.S. Census Bureau, means an area that is administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The U.S. Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data.\n\nTribal Designated Statistical Areas (TDSAs)\nStatistical entities identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by federally recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have a federally recognized land base (reservation or off-reservation trust land). A TDSA generally encompasses a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with a federally recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. TDSAs are associated with Census Class Codes of 000 to 9989 for the 1990 datalayer.  A TDSA may be located in more than one state, but it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for TDSAs in conjunction with the 1990 census, when both federally and state recognized tribes could identify and delineate TDSAs. For Census 2000, TDSAs now apply only to federally recognized tribes. State recognized tribes without a land base, including those that were TDSAs in 1990, are identified as state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs), a new geographic entity for Census 2000. \n\nTribal Jurisdiction Statistical Areas (TJSAs)\n1990 statistical entities identified and delineated for the 1990 census to provide a geographic frame of reference for the presentation of statistical data. 1990 TJSA boundaries were required to follow census block boundaries and were based upon the boundaries of the former reservations of federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma. The range of Census Class Codes associated with TJSAs is 5000 to 5989. TJSAs replaced the Historic Areas of Oklahoma recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1980 decennial census. The 1990 descriptive designation, TJSA, has been changed for Census 2000 to Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs).",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Key Geographic Locations (KGLs), as defined by the US Census Bureau, throughout the state. Essential attribute data included are KGL Name and Census Feature Class Code (CFCC). Predominant features represented in this layer include: Airports or airfields; Custodial Facility (hospital, orphanage, Federal penitentiary, state prison); Educational or Religious Institution (convent or monastery, educational institution, religious institution); Multihousehold or Transient Quarters (apartment buildings and complexes, trailer courts or mobile home parks, campground, hotels, motels); Shopping centers or major retail centers; Transportation Terminal (train station, bus or marine terminal).\n\nPlease note that many other feature types may be present in this layer. Key geographic locations (KGLs) represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty.\n\nThe Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration.\n\n A landmark can be a point, line, or area type. In some cases, the Census TIGER data base permits a choice of types. For instance, an airport or airfield might appear as a point, line, or area; the approach depends on the size of the feature and the depiction of the feature in the source document. Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types\n\nA census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category.\n\nLandmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location. A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.",

Block Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract having the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number.  For example, block group 3 (BG 3) within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from 3000 to 3999. \n\nCensus 2000 BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the U.S. Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant.\n\nA BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urbanized areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian/Alaska Native areas/Hawaiian home lands. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian homeland census geographic hierarchy, census tracts and BGs are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as Tribal BGs.\n\nBGs have a valid range of 0 through 9. BGs beginning with a 0 generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three mile territorial sea limit, the U.S. Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The U.S. Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0000 and BG of 0 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.\n\nIn decennial census data tabulations, a block group may be split to present data for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, voting district, congressional district, American Indian area/Alaska Native area/ Hawaiian home land shown in the data tabulation products.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays the Type A class roads thoughout the state.\nFeature Class A roads include: Primary roads with limited access (interstate highways, toll highways); Primary roads without limited access (US highways, some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns); regional and state highways state highways, Secondary and connecting roads (includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods); Local, neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, and vehicular trails.\n\nAccording to the TIGER95 Data Dictionary, the definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having, \"..opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas.\" This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update.\n\nRoad types possibly represented here are defined as follows:\n\n-Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.\n-Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics.\n-Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways.\n-Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads.\n-Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in category\n-Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics.\n-Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.",

VMAP data set products use the \"vector product format\" (vpf) utilized first by the US Defense Mapping Agency and later by its successor, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA, now known as the NGA). \"VMap\" is derived from \"Vector Smart Map.\"\n\nVector Smart Map (VMAP) Level 1 is a global vector GIS dataset at 1:250,000 scale. This is currently the most detailed global digital dataset freely available and can be downloaded from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NGA) website, using their GeoSpatial Engine.  The coverage is not complete - of the 234 zones which make up the dataset, only around 25% are currently (2002) available - others have not yet been completed or are not declassified.  They feature a vast number of files organized into libraries. These libraries, or coverages, are geographically bounded areas, rather than feature-linked coverages.  \n\nVMAP Layers in the Harvard Geospatial Library are feature-based as we have processed the multiple tiles from the VMAP libraries into a series of seamless coverages (e.g. Aqueduct Lines appear in a single layer, \"Aqueduct Lines\") which depict a particular feature as it occurs throughout the available geographic coverage areas.  Since different geographic areas were mapped by NIMA at different times using various types of feature capture and scanning and digitizing methods and software, multiple map sources of varying dates and multiple processing approaches are represented in each of these HGL layers. We have necessarily generalized the discussion of data source material and process steps in the Data Quality section of this metadata document.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Voting district is the generic name for geographic entities such as precincts, wards, and election districts established by State governments for the purpose of conducting elections.  States participating in the 2010 Census Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) provided the Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs.  Each VTD is identified by a 1- to 6-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county.  For the 2010 Census, Rhode Island is the only State that did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs exist for this State in the 2010 Census data products.

The report includes records from dedicated aerial surveys and other platforms. Bias from uneven allocation of survey effort (temporally or spatially) was corrected using a sighting-per-unit-effort (SPUE) algorithm. SPUE values for each 5 x 5 minute grid cell were then interpolated spatially. The resulting interpolations were classified into quantiles and exported as filled contour polygon shapefiles. NOAA binned the data into five classes, and Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) biologists and CZM extracted the top two classes of the data to represent \"core\" habitat. These classes represent interpolated SPUE values greater than or equal to 17.1.\n\nSee the NOAA report for additional information on their methods:\nNOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) 2006.

These data were converted to the planning area grid by extracting all of the cells in which the data layer occurred.",
