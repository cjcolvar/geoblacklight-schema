             "dc_description_s" => "This datalayer displays County Subdivisions (Minor Civil Divisions) for the state, based on legal and statistical entities established on January 1, 2000. County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their statistical equivalents for the reporting of decennial census data. They include: Census County Divisions; Census Sub-areas; Minor Civil Divisions, and Unorganized Territories. The TIGER/Line files contain a 5-character numeric FIPS code field for county subdivisions. The Census Bureau has established Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs) for Guam.\n\nLegal Entities:\n\nMinor Civil Divisions (MCDs)\nMCDs are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states. MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. MCDs are variously designated as American Indian reservations, assessment districts, boroughs, election districts, gores, grants, locations, magisterial districts, parish governing authority districts, plantations, precincts, purchases, road districts, supervisor's districts, towns, and townships. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in 28 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and the District of Columbia is considered equivalent to an MCD for statistical purposes. \n- In some states, all or some incorporated places are not part of any MCD. These places also serve as primary legal subdivisions and have a unique FIPS MCD code that is the same as the FIPS place code. The TIGER/ Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the county subdivision field and the place field. In other states, incorporated places are part of the MCDs in which they are located, or the pattern is mixed; some incorporated places are independent of MCDs and others are included within one or more MCDs.\n- The MCDs in 12 states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places. The U.S. Census Bureau presents data for these MCDs in all data products in which it provides data for places.\n- In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as the statistical equivalent of MCDs for purposes of data presentation.\n\nStatistical Entities:\n\nCensus County Divisions (CCDs)\nCCDs are areas delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with state officials and local officials for statistical purposes. CCDs have no legal function and are not governmental units. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and in most cases, coincide with census tract boundaries. The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location. CCDs exist where:\n1) There are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs).\n2) The legally established MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes.\n3) The boundaries of the MCDs change frequently.\n4) The MCDs are not generally known to the public.\n\nCensus Subareas\nCensus subareas are statistical subdivisions of boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and census areas, the statistical equivalent entities for counties in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau cooperatively delineate the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs. Census subareas were first used in the 1980 census.\n\nUnorganized Territories (UTs)\nThe U.S. Census Bureau defines unorganized territories in 10 minor civil division (MCD) states where portions of counties are not included in any legally established MCD or incorporated place. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes such separate pieces of territory as one or more separate county subdivisions for census purposes. It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name, followed by the designation \"unorganized territory\" and a county subdivision code. Unorganized territories were first reported in the 1960 census. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns a default county subdivision code of 00000 in some coastal and Great Lakes water where county subdivisions do not extend into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit.",

             "dc_description_s" => "This datalayer depicts feature location and other associated data for American Indian tribal entities for those entities established on January 1, 1990. American Indian Reservations are areas that have been set aside by the United States for the use of tribes, the exterior boundaries of which are more particularly defined in the final tribal treaties, agreements, executive orders, federal statutes, secretarial orders, or judicial determinations. The Census Class Code range associated with American Indian Reservations is 0001 to 4989 for the 1990 datalayer.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau recognizes federal reservations as territory over which American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority. These entities are known as colonies, communities, pueblos, rancherias, ranches, reservations, reserves, villages, Indian communities, and Indian villages. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) maintains a list of federally recognized tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau contacts representatives of American Indian tribal governments to identify the boundaries for federal reservations. Federal reservations may cross state, county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. The BIA supplied the U.S. Census Bureau with the names and exterior boundaries of the federal AIRs used for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for American Indian reservations in the 1970 census.\nThere are both legal and statistical American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides data. The legal entities consist of federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, the tribal subdivisions that can divide these entities, state recognized American Indian reservations, Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs), and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs). Tribal subdivisions can exist within the statistical Oklahoma tribal statistical areas. In all cases, these areas are mutually exclusive in that no American Indian, Alaska Native, or Hawaiian home land can overlap another tribal entity, except for tribal subdivisions, which subdivide some American Indian entities, and Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), which exist within Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs). \n\nAmerican Indian Trust Lands\nAreas for which the United States holds title in trust for the benefit of a tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual Indian (individual trust land). Trust lands can be alienated or encumbered only by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his/her authorized representative. Trust lands may be located on or off a reservation. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data for reservations and off-reservation trust lands because American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority over these lands. Primary tribal governmental authority generally is not attached to tribal lands located off the reservation until the lands are placed in trust. In U.S. Census Bureau data tabulations, off-reservation trust lands always are associated with a specific federally recognized reservation and/or tribal government. A tribal government appointed liaison provides the name and boundaries of their trust lands. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), an agency in the U.S. Department of the Interior, identified and provided maps of these areas for use by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for off-reservation tribal trust lands in the 1980 census; in 1990, the trust land data included both tribal and individual trust lands. The U.S. Census Bureau does not identify fee land (or land in fee simple status) or restricted fee lands as specific geographic categories and they are not identified in the TIGER/Line files. Trust lands are assigned the same code as the reservation with which they are associated. Trust lands associated with tribes that do not have a reservation are assigned codes based on tribal name. In the TIGER/Line files, a letter code-\"T\" for tribal and \"I\" for individual-appears in a separate field and identifies off-reservation trust lands.\n\nAmerican Indian Reservations-State (State AIRs) \nReservations established by some state governments for tribes recognized by the state. A governor-appointed state liaison provides the names and boundaries for state recognized American Indian reservations to the U.S. Census Bureau. State reservations may cross county, county subdivision, and place boundaries.\n\nAmerican Indian Tribal Subdivisions\nAdministrative subdivisions of federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust land, or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs). Tribal subdivisions are known as areas, chapters, communities, or districts. These entities are internal units of self-government or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for the American Indians on the reservations, off-reservation trust lands, or OTSAs. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundary and name information for tribal subdivisions from tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in 1980 when it identified them as \"American Indian sub-reservation areas.\" The U.S. Census Bureau did not provide data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in conjunction with the 1990 census.\n\nJoint Use Areas\nAs applied to any American Indian area/Alaska Native area by the U.S. Census Bureau, means an area that is administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The U.S. Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data.\n\nTribal Designated Statistical Areas (TDSAs)\nStatistical entities identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by federally recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have a federally recognized land base (reservation or off-reservation trust land). A TDSA generally encompasses a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with a federally recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. TDSAs are associated with Census Class Codes of 000 to 9989 for the 1990 datalayer.  A TDSA may be located in more than one state, but it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for TDSAs in conjunction with the 1990 census, when both federally and state recognized tribes could identify and delineate TDSAs. For Census 2000, TDSAs now apply only to federally recognized tribes. State recognized tribes without a land base, including those that were TDSAs in 1990, are identified as state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs), a new geographic entity for Census 2000. \n\nTribal Jurisdiction Statistical Areas (TJSAs)\n1990 statistical entities identified and delineated for the 1990 census to provide a geographic frame of reference for the presentation of statistical data. 1990 TJSA boundaries were required to follow census block boundaries and were based upon the boundaries of the former reservations of federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma. The range of Census Class Codes associated with TJSAs is 5000 to 5989. TJSAs replaced the Historic Areas of Oklahoma recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1980 decennial census. The 1990 descriptive designation, TJSA, has been changed for Census 2000 to Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs).",

Train cars and engines are repaired, switched, and dispatched from a yard.\nRailroads with special characteristics, or railroads or portions of a railroad track that are parts of the railroad system and have separately identifiable characteristics such as ferry crossings, carlines, a track for street cars, trolleys and other special types.  These special characteristic feature types are not typically depicted in all layers.

States participating in the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) may provide the U.S. Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs.

For a state or county that did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, the codes fields are blank.

The U.S. Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. \nCensus 2000 is the first decennial census for which the entire United States has census tracts. In 1990 some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts. Block groups and census blocks are uniquely numbered within census tract (except for Census 2000 collection blocks which were uniquely numbered within county).\nCensus tracts generally have a population size between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.\n\nBoundaries and Boundary Changes \nCensus tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. Census tract boundaries may follow legal boundaries, such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries, in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries are al-ways census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land census geographic hierarchy, tribal census tracts are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of discontiguous areas. These discontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves discontiguous.\n\nCensus Tracts in American Indian Areas \nThe U.S. Census Bureau has reserved the census tract numbering range of 9400 to 9499 for use by American Indian area participants in situations where an American Indian entity crosses county or state boundaries. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land census geographic hierarchy, the U.S. Census Bureau will tabulate census tract data within federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands ignoring state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as tribal census tracts.",

The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in conjunction with the 1970 census. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name.\n\nThe program identified three possible levels of school districts representing different segments of the school-age population (elementary, intermediate, and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represented all grade levels. The elementary, intermediate, and secondary levels of a school district may overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, an intermediate school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The 1995 TIGER files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels.\n\nThe 1995 TIGER files contain a unified school district code for those school districts where all levels are represented in a single district. The elementary, intermediate, and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code.\n\nSchool districts may cut through existing census blocks. In such instances, the Census Bureau created new complete chains and GT polygons. However, the school district boundaries did not create new blocks. The tabulation blocks may contain more than one polygon, and each polygon may have a different school district code. The block parts/polygons allocated to the different school districts do not have separate tabulation block numbers. Thus, a school district in the TIGER files is a representation of the area, not the actual area. The 1995 TIGER files store the school district codes in a set of four, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 9999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district. Some large water areas have a pseudo-school district code of 99998.",

Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs).\n\nCensus tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement, delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. \nCensus tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties (see TRIBAL CENSUS TRACTS). The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",

The data here were originally produced by MassGIS.\nThe Solid Waste Facility Datalayer was compiled by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Division of Solid Waste Management to track the locations of landfills, transfer stations, and combustion facilities. The datalayer contains the majority of the facilities currently regulated under DEP's solid waste regulations (310 CMR 16.00   19.00). The 554 polygons in the datalayer include thirteen specific types of solid waste facilities (see ATTRIBUTES below)\nPlease Note: Although the majority of the polygons represent landfills, only a small fraction of those landfills are active. In addition, this datalayer does not contain all solid waste facilities known to DEP. The Mass GIS land-use datalayer has waste site and mining classifications which may represent landfills not in the solid waste datalayer. \nThis layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) which was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns.

             "dc_description_s" => "This datalayer displays Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) for the state. \n\nMSAs are Metropolitan Areas (MAs) that are not closely associated with other MAs. These areas typically are surrounded by non-metropolitan counties (county subdivisions in New England). There are three types of metropolitan areas. If a metropolitan area has a total population of less than 1,000,000, the area is designated a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Metropolitan areas with a population of 1,000,000 or greater qualify for designation as a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) that is composed of smaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs). This designation is not automatic; the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) solicits local opinion to designate CMSAs and their component PMSAs.\n\n\nPMSAs consist of a county or cluster of counties (cities and towns in New England) that demonstrate very strong internal economic and social links, in addition to close ties to other portions of the larger area. When PMSAs are established, the larger MA of which they are component parts is designated a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA). CMSAs and PMSAs are established only where local governments favor such a designation for a large MA.\n\nMetropolitan Areas (MAs) are designated and defined by the OMB, following a set of official standards that are published in a Federal Register Notice. These standards were developed by the interagency Metropolitan Area Standards Review Committee, with the aim of producing definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MAs nationwide. The general concept of an MA is one of a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Some MAs are defined around two or more nuclei. Each MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of 50,000 or a U.S. Census Bureau defined urbanized area and a total MA population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). An MA contains one or more central counties and may include one or more outlying counties that have close economic and social relationships with the central county. An outlying county must have a specified level of commuting to the central counties and also must meet certain standards regarding metropolitan character, such as population density, urban population, and population growth. In New England, MAs consist of cities and towns rather than whole counties. The territory, population, and housing units in MAs are referred to as \"metropolitan.\" The metropolitan category is subdivided into \"inside central city\" and \"outside central city.\" The territory, population, and housing units located outside MAs are referred to as \"non-metropolitan.\" The metropolitan and non-metropolitan classification cuts across the other hierarchies; for example, there is generally both urban and rural territory within both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.\n\nStatistical entities which share some relation to the MSA include:\n\nCentral City\nIn each metropolitan statistical area and consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the largest place and, in some cases, one or more additional places are designated as ''central cities'' under the official standards. A few primary metropolitan statistical areas do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities, are included in the title of the metropolitan area (MA); there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that place that extends outside the MA boundary.\n\nMetropolitan Area Central Cities\nsmaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities are included in the title of the MA; there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that place that extends outside the MA boundary.\n\nNew England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs)\nNew England county metropolitan areas (NECMAs) are defined as a county-based alternative to the city and town based New England MSAs and CMSAs. The NECMA defined for an MSA or CMSA includes:\n- The county containing the first-named city in that MSA/CMSA title (this county may include the first-named cities of other MSAs/CMSAs as well.\n- Each additional county having at least half its population in the MSAs/CMSAs whose first-named cities are in the previously identified county.\nNECMAs are not identified for individual PMSAs. Only the CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs appear in the TIGER/Line files. The U.S. Census Bureau does not include NECMAs in the TIGER/Line files.",

The geographic extent of this Theme is the Atlanta Region 13-county area which includes ARC's 10 counties, plus the EPA non-attainment counties of Forsyth, Paulding, and Coweta.  Though the terms are often used interchangeably, landuse and landcover are not synonymous.  Landcover generally refers to the natural or cultivated vegetation, rock, or water covering the land, as well as the developed surface which can be identified on aerial photography.  Landuse generally refers to the way that humans use or will use the land, regardless of its apparent landcover.  As such, this theme is primarily a landcover database with an extra landuse component which is essential to many of ARC's key agency functions\nARC documentation states that:\nThis land use/cover theme was created by on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing of ortho-rectified aerial photography at a scale of 1:14,000.  The primary sources for this mapping effort were 1999 natural color imagery with four-foot pixel resolution, provided by Aerials Express, Inc. (formerly DigiAir, Inc.) and 1999 color infrared (CIR) digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs) with one-meter pixel resolution, provided by the US Geological Survey (USGS) through the Georgia GIS Clearinghouse.  Using both sources of imagery, landcover polygons were delineated using ARC's previous (1995) landuse/cover GIS database as the principal source of collateral (secondary) data.  Where possible, all newly digitized arcs were aligned to the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) DLG-F street centerlines, which were used, along with the 1995 landuse/cover dataset, as primary \"backcoverages\" in ArcEdit.",

The legal definition of a coastal country would include offshore ocean areas, while with a graphic depiction, the country ends at the ocean shoreline. Please note that the ocean shoreline is included in the Political/Oceans line coverage only and is not repeated in the Drainage or Hypsography layers. This type of feature organization enables selection of countries as areas and the distinction of the land and water areas of the world.\n\nThis layer was derived from the VMAP0 series produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), formerly known as NIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency), an agency of the United States government. VMAP data set products use the \"vector product format\" (vpf). The term \"VMap\" is derived from \"Vector Smart Map.\"\n\nDigital Chart of the World is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data. The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features.\n\nThe coverage is  is organized into 10 thematic layers which feature a vast number of files organized into libraries. These libraries, or coverages, are geographicially bounded areas, rather than feature-linked coverages.  \n\nDCW Layers in the Harvard Geospatial Library are feature-based as we have processed the multiple tiles from the VMAP0 libraries into a series of seamless coverages (e.g. aeronautical features appear in a single layer, \"Aeronautical Facilities, Points\") which depict a particular feature as it occurs throughout the available geographic coverage areas.  Since different geographic areas were mapped by NIMA at different times using various types of feature capture and scanning and digitizing methods and software, multiple map sources of varying dates and multiple processing approaches are represented in each of these HGL layers. We have necessarily generalized the discussion of data source material and process steps in the Data Quality section of this metadata document.",

If place names are duplicated within a state, and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by primary county in which each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, alphabetically by their legal description (for example, ''city'' before ''village'').\n\nStatistical entities which may be represented in this datalyer include:\n\nCensus Designated Place (CDP).\nCensus designated places (CDPs) are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.\n\nConsolidated City. \nAn incorporated place that has combined its governmental functions with a county or subcounty entity but contains one or more other incorporated places that continue to function as local governments within the consolidated government.\n\nIncorporated Place.\nA type of governmental unit, incorporated under state law as a city, town (except in New England, New York, and  Wisconsin), borough (except in Alaska and New York), or village, having legally prescribed limits, powers, and functions.",

Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs).\n\nCensus tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement, delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. \nCensus tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties (see TRIBAL CENSUS TRACTS). The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",

These special characteristic feature types are not typically depicted in all layers.  For example, Ferry crossings, or the representation of a route over water used by ships carrying train cars to connecting railroads on opposite shores, are are primarily located on the Great Lakes and will be found predominantly in railroad layers for states in that region.",

             "dc_description_s" => "This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the state. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs).\n\nCensus tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement, delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. \nCensus tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties (see TRIBAL CENSUS TRACTS). The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",

Series source sheets were published in 1994-1995 by the United States Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Center.\n\nThe source map was scanned and georeferenced for Harvard University's Center for Geographic Analysis' AfricaMap project by East View Cartographic.  Individual TLM sheets covering Burundi (40 sheets in total) were selected from the TLM worldwide series.\n\nDMA Topographic Line Map series maps are typical topographic maps portraying both natural and manmade features. They show and name works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc.  They also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc.  Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 20 meters, with some sheets having supplemental meter contours, form lines, hachures, shading, and/or spot heights. Depths shown by bathymetric isolines.\n\nPlease pay close attention to map collar information on projections, spheroid, compilation dates, legend information, and keys to grid numbering and other numbers which appear inside the neatline.",

The DFIRM Database is the digital, geospatial version of the flood hazard information shown on the published paper Flood Insurance Rate Maps(FIRMs). The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk.  The NFHL data are derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data where available.  The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.  The NFHL data contain layers in the Standard DFIRM datasets except for S_Label_Pt and S_Label_Ld.  The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets.

Covers portions of Ismailia region, Egypt.\n\nMap quadrangle number: NH 36-6.  \nEdition statement:  Ed. 4 - AMS.\n\nCompiled in 1959 from: Egypt 1:50,000, AMS compiled 1958-59; Egypt 1:100,000, AMS, Compiled 1959; USHO Chart 2431, revised 1956.\n\nThe image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to World Geodetic System (1984) coordinates. All map collar information is also available as part of the raster image. Series source sheets are of varying compilation dates (1951-1964) and editions, published by the Army Map Service.\n\nAMS Series P502 maps are in English. Each source map in the series is printed in color at a scale of 1:250,000. \n\nThe source map was selected and downloaded from the University of Texas Libraries Web site by the Harvard University Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) and georeferenced for the CGA's AfricaMap project by East View Cartographic. Individual AMS sheets covering a small portion of Africa (146 sheets in total) were selected from AMS series of: North Africa (P502), West Africa (G504), and South Africa (Z501).\n\nAMS Series maps are typical topographic maps portraying both natural and manmade features. They show and name works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc.  They also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc.  Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 50 meters, with some sheets having supplemental meter contours, form lines, hachures, shading, and/or spot heights. Depths shown by bathymetric isolines.\n\nPlease pay close attention to map collar information on projections, spheroid, planimetric revision methods and dates, and keys to grid numbering and other numbers which appear inside the neatline.",
