For descriptions of these community systems, refer to Barbour, Simmons, Swain and Woolsey, \"Our Irreplaceable Heritage: Protecting Biodiversity in Massachusetts\" (1998). SPECIFICS FOR THE PINE BARREN COMMUNITIES:Pine Barrens Systems are a mosaic of pitch pine and scrub oak, with heath and grassy openings, located on nutrient-poor, acidic, drought-prone soils. Most of this data is in the southeast a subset of the UMass Plymouth pitch pine data layer (1993). Some revisions have been made to the UMass data (false labels corrected, edges tied, some new developed land removed). This layer is a new and separate datalayer created for pitch pine barrens outside the UMass project area. This new data was created from aerial photo interpretation of the 1999/2000 photos and field information.MassGIS is maintaining this layer.  Questions concerning the data interpretation should be directed to Janice Stone at 413-545-5533 or Philip John at 617-626-1185.

Block Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract having the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number.  For example, block group 3 (BG 3) within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from 3000 to 3999. \n\nCensus 2000 BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the U.S. Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant.\n\nA BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urbanized areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian/Alaska Native areas/Hawaiian home lands. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian homeland census geographic hierarchy, census tracts and BGs are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as Tribal BGs.\n\nBGs have a valid range of 0 through 9. BGs beginning with a 0 generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three mile territorial sea limit, the U.S. Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The U.S. Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0000 and BG of 0 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.\n\nIn decennial census data tabulations, a block group may be split to present data for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, voting district, congressional district, American Indian area/Alaska Native area/ Hawaiian home land shown in the data tabulation products.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) for the state. \n\nMSAs are Metropolitan Areas (MAs) that are not closely associated with other MAs. These areas typically are surrounded by non-metropolitan counties (county subdivisions in New England). There are three types of metropolitan areas. If a metropolitan area has a total population of less than 1,000,000, the area is designated a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Metropolitan areas with a population of 1,000,000 or greater qualify for designation as a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) that is composed of smaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs). This designation is not automatic; the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) solicits local opinion to designate CMSAs and their component PMSAs.\n\nPMSAs consist of a county or cluster of counties (cities and towns in New England) that demonstrate very strong internal economic and social links, in addition to close ties to other portions of the larger area. When PMSAs are established, the larger MA of which they are component parts is designated a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA). CMSAs and PMSAs are established only where local governments favor such a designation for a large MA.\n\nMetropolitan Areas (MAs) are designated and defined by the OMB, following a set of official standards that are published in a Federal Register Notice. These standards were developed by the interagency Metropolitan Area Standards Review Committee, with the aim of producing definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MAs nationwide. The general concept of an MA is one of a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Some MAs are defined around two or more nuclei. Each MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of 50,000 or a U.S. Census Bureau defined urbanized area and a total MA population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). An MA contains one or more central counties and may include one or more outlying counties that have close economic and social relationships with the central county. An outlying county must have a specified level of commuting to the central counties and also must meet certain standards regarding metropolitan character, such as population density, urban population, and population growth. In New England, MAs consist of cities and towns rather than whole counties. The territory, population, and housing units in MAs are referred to as \"metropolitan.\" The metropolitan category is subdivided into \"inside central city\" and \"outside central city.\" The territory, population, and housing units located outside MAs are referred to as \"non-metropolitan.\" The metropolitan and non-metropolitan classification cuts across the other hierarchies; for example, there is generally both urban and rural territory within both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.\n\nStatistical entities which share some relation to the MSA include:\n\nCentral City\nIn each metropolitan statistical area and consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the largest place and, in some cases, one or more additional places are designated as ''central cities'' under the official standards. A few primary metropolitan statistical areas do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities, are included in the title of the metropolitan area (MA); there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that place that extends outside the MA boundary.\n\nMetropolitan Area Central Cities\nsmaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities are included in the title of the MA; there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that place that extends outside the MA boundary.\n\nNew England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs)\nNew England county metropolitan areas (NECMAs) are defined as a county-based alternative to the city and town based New England MSAs and CMSAs. The NECMA defined for an MSA or CMSA includes:\n- The county containing the first-named city in that MSA/CMSA title (this county may include the first-named cities of other MSAs/CMSAs as well.\n- Each additional county having at least half its population in the MSAs/CMSAs whose first-named cities are in the previously identified county.\nNECMAs are not identified for individual PMSAs. Only the CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs appear in the TIGER/Line files. The U.S. Census Bureau does not include NECMAs in the TIGER/Line files.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the state, based on boundaries established on January 1, 2000. \nCensus tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county (or statistical equivalent of a county), and are defined by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. \nCensus 2000 is the first decennial census for which the entire United States has census tracts. In 1990 some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts. Block groups and census blocks are uniquely numbered within census tract (except for Census 2000 collection blocks which were uniquely numbered within county).\nCensus tracts generally have a population size between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.\n\nBoundaries and Boundary Changes \nCensus tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. Census tract boundaries may follow legal boundaries, such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries, in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries are al-ways census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land census geographic hierarchy, tribal census tracts are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of discontiguous areas. These discontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves discontiguous.\n\nCensus Tracts in American Indian Areas \nThe U.S. Census Bureau has reserved the census tract numbering range of 9400 to 9499 for use by American Indian area participants in situations where an American Indian entity crosses county or state boundaries. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land census geographic hierarchy, the U.S. Census Bureau will tabulate census tract data within federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands ignoring state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as tribal census tracts.",

County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their statistical equivalents for the reporting of decennial census data. They include: Census County Divisions; Census Sub-areas; Minor Civil Divisions, and Unorganized Territories. The TIGER/Line files contain a 5-character numeric FIPS code field for county subdivisions. The Census Bureau has established Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs) for Minnesota. Unorganized Territories are recognized in Minnesota.\n\nLegal Entities:\n\nMinor Civil Divisions (MCDs)\nMCDs are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states. MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. MCDs are variously designated as American Indian reservations, assessment districts, boroughs, election districts, gores, grants, locations, magisterial districts, parish governing authority districts, plantations, precincts, purchases, road districts, supervisor's districts, towns, and townships. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in 28 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and the District of Columbia is considered equivalent to an MCD for statistical purposes. \n- In some states, all or some incorporated places are not part of any MCD. These places also serve as primary legal subdivisions and have a unique FIPS MCD code that is the same as the FIPS place code. The TIGER/ Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the county subdivision field and the place field. In other states, incorporated places are part of the MCDs in which they are located, or the pattern is mixed; some incorporated places are independent of MCDs and others are included within one or more MCDs.\n- The MCDs in 12 states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places. The U.S. Census Bureau presents data for these MCDs in all data products in which it provides data for places.\n- In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as the statistical equivalent of MCDs for purposes of data presentation.\n\nStatistical Entities:\n\nCensus County Divisions (CCDs)\nCCDs are areas delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with state officials and local officials for statistical purposes. CCDs have no legal function and are not governmental units. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and in most cases, coincide with census tract boundaries. The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location. CCDs exist where:\n1) There are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs).\n2) The legally established MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes.\n3) The boundaries of the MCDs change frequently.\n4) The MCDs are not generally known to the public.\n\nCensus Subareas\nCensus subareas are statistical subdivisions of boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and census areas, the statistical equivalent entities for counties in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau cooperatively delineate the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs. Census subareas were first used in the 1980 census.\n\nUnorganized Territories (UTs)\nThe U.S. Census Bureau defines unorganized territories in 10 minor civil division (MCD) states where portions of counties are not included in any legally established MCD or incorporated place. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes such separate pieces of territory as one or more separate county subdivisions for census purposes. It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name, followed by the designation \"unorganized territory\" and a county subdivision code. Unorganized territories were first reported in the 1960 census. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns a default county subdivision code of 00000 in some coastal and Great Lakes water where county subdivisions do not extend into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the state, based on entity boundaries established on January 1, 1990. \nCensus tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county (or statistical equivalent of a county), and are defined by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. \nCensus 2000 is the first decennial census for which the entire United States has census tracts. In 1990 some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts. Block groups and census blocks are uniquely numbered within census tract (except for Census 2000 collection blocks which were uniquely numbered within county).\nCensus tracts generally have a population size between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.\n\nBoundaries and Boundary Changes \nCensus tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. Census tract boundaries may follow legal boundaries, such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries, in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries are al-ways census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land census geographic hierarchy, tribal census tracts are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of discontiguous areas. These discontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves discontiguous.\n\nCensus Tracts in American Indian Areas \nThe U.S. Census Bureau has reserved the census tract numbering range of 9400 to 9499 for use by American Indian area participants in situations where an American Indian entity crosses county or state boundaries. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land census geographic hierarchy, the U.S. Census Bureau will tabulate census tract data within federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands ignoring state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as tribal census tracts.",

    "dc_description_s": "The polygons in this datalayer represent ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) for the entire state. \nZCTAs are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary statistics from Census 2000. This new entity was developed to overcome the difficulties in precisely defining the land area covered by each ZIP Code. Defining the extent of an area is necessary in order to accurately tabulate census data for that area. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. Simply put, each one is built by aggregating the Census 2000 blocks, whose addresses use a given ZIP Code, into a ZCTA which gets that ZIP Code assigned as its ZCTA code. They represent the majority USPS five-digit ZIP Code found in a given area. For those areas where it is difficult to determine the prevailing five-digit ZIP Code, the higher-level three-digit ZIP Code is used for the ZCTA code. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:\n- ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the addresses within that census block.\n- ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPS's ZIP Code delivery areas.\n- ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.\n- ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.\n- ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.\n- ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.\n- ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census 2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.\n- ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.\n- ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another. \n\nZCTAs are approximate area representations of United States Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the U.S. Census Bureau is creating for statistical purposes for Census 2000. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. Each Census 2000 tabulation block will have a single ZCTA code that will reflect the majority ZIP Code for addresses within that tabulation block. A ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. For instance, a special purpose ZIP Code may represent a point location that does not characterize the majority of the addresses for a Census 2000 tabulation block. Under these circumstances the special purpose ZIP Code will not appear as a ZCTA.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau will be identifying ZCTAs by using a five-character alpha-numeric code. The first three characters will represent the 3-digit ZIP Code and may contain leading zeros. For ZCTAs defined only by a 3-digit ZIP Code the last two characters of the ZCTA code will be \"XX.\" For example, ZCTA code \"290XX\" will represent the generic 3-digit ZIP Code290 where no 5-digit ZIP Code was available. For ZCTA codes that will reflect the 5-digit ZIP Code, the last two characters of the ZCTA code will be numeric. For example, the ZCTA code \"00601\" will represent the 5-digit ZIP Code 00601. The ZCTA delineation process will not recognize ZCTA codes ending in \"00\", such as \"29000\", as valid 5-digit ZCTA codes. Some water features will have a 3-digit ZCTA code followed by \"HH\", for example \"290HH\". These codes will apply only to water features and usually will belong to water features located along the edges of 5-digit ZCTAs. The codes will indicate that the water feature does not clearly fall within one 5-digit ZCTA and is distinct from the 3-digit ZCTA code that will be assigned to land areas. In effect, these codes will identify unassigned water areas. The ZCTA delineation process will attempt to assign a 5-digit ZCTA code to areas with no ZIP Code or address data. Where reliable data are unavailable for extensive areas, the ZCTA code may represent the more general 3-digit ZIP Code.",

    "dc_description_s": "The polygons in this datalayer represent U.S. Census Blocks for the entire state. Census blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Generally census blocks are small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas may be large and irregular and contain hundreds of square miles. All territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas have block numbers. Blocks are composed of one or more GT-polygons; that is, several GT-polygons can share the same block number.\n\nCensus 2000 Block Numbers.\nCensus 2000 tabulation blocks are numbered uniquely within each state/county/census tract with a four-digit census block number. The U.S. Census Bureau created the tabulation block numbers immediately before beginning its Census 2000 data tabulation process, thereby eliminating block suffixes. The first digit of the tabulation block number identifies the block group. For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned a unique 1990 block number with a suffix of \"Z\" to identify crews-of-vessels population. For Census 2000, crews-of-vessels population is assigned to the land block identified by the U.S. Census Bureau as associated with the home port of the vessel.\n\nWater Blocks.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau introduced a different method for identifying the water areas of census blocks for Census 2000. For the 1990 census, water was not uniquely identified within a census block; instead, all water area internal to a block group was given a single block number ending in \"99\" (for example, in block group 1, all water was identified as block 199). A suffix was added to each 1990 water block number where the block existed in more than one tabulation entity within its block group. For Census 2000, water area located completely within the boundary of a single land block has the same block number as that land block. Water area that touches more than one land block is assigned a unique block number not associated with any adjacent land block. The U.S. Census Bureau assigned water block numbers beginning with the block group number followed by \"999 \" and preceding in descending order. For example, in block group 3, the block numbers assigned to water areas that border multiple land blocks are 3999, 3998, 3997, and so forth. Because some land blocks include water (ponds and small lakes), no conclusions about whether or not a block is all land or all water can be made by looking at the Census 2000 block numbers. Data users must use the WATER field on Record Type S to determine if the GT-polygon is land or water. The WATER field has two values, 0 for land or 1 for water.\nNOTE: For additional information on this or other layers in the UA Census 2000 TIGER dataset please consult the U.S. Census Bureau's technical documentation at: http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tigerua/ua2ktgr.pdf",

School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, tribal, or local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files contain school district information from the 1999-2000 school year.\n\nThe UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files identify three levels of school districts representing different grade ranges of the school-age population (elementary and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represent all grade levels. The elementary and secondary levels of a school district can overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, a secondary school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The TIGER/Line files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files contain a Unified School District code for those school districts where all grade levels are represented in a single district. The elementary and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code. An exception exists for the State of Hawaii and the five boroughs of New York city where the National School District Program requested that the U.S. Census Bureau include the School Complex Areas in Hawaii and the Community School Districts in New York city. In Massachusetts. South Carolina, and Tennessee some unified school districts also serve as secondary school districts in areas where there are elementary school districts. In these situations, the U.S. Census Bureau could not use the same school district code to identify school districts serving different grade ranges and has assigned two separate codes; a unified school district code and a separate \"false\" secondary school district code. Data users can identify the \"false\" school districts by looking for \"false\" as part of the school district name appearing in Record Type C. A few additional exceptions occur where the Department of Defense operates elementary schools within a unified school district.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files store the school district codes in a set of three, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 99999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district. Some large water areas have a pseudo-school district code of 99998.",

A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.\nThe predominant feature classes represented in this layer include airports or airfields, cemeteries, fraternities or sororities, state or local parks or forests, golf courses, lookout towers, educational and religious institutions.  Other possible landmark features could include military installations, multi-household or transient quarters, custodial facilities, other types of transportation facilities or terminals, employment centers, open space and other special landmark designations for post offices, police stations and firehouses.\n\nThe Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration.\n\nA census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category.\n\nLandmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location.",

The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the U.S. Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant.\n\nA BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urbanized areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian/Alaska Native areas/Hawaiian home lands. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian homeland census geographic hierarchy, census tracts and BGs are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as Tribal BGs.\n\nBGs have a valid range of 0 through 9. BGs beginning with a 0 generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three mile territorial sea limit, the U.S. Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The U.S. Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0000 and BG of 0 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.\n\nIn decennial census data tabulations, a block group may be split to present data for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, voting district, congressional district, American Indian area/Alaska Native area/ Hawaiian home land shown in the data tabulation products.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays the Urbanized Areas (UAs) for the state based on a January 1, 2000 ground condition. Note that the Census Bureau made significant changes in Urban/Rural designations for the Census 2000 data layers.  Some of these delineations and definitions are explained below.\n\nFor Census 2000 the U.S. Census Bureau classifies as urban all territory, population, and housing units located within urbanized areas (UAs) and urban clusters (UCs). It delineates UA and UC boundaries to encompass densely settled territory, which generally consists of: \n- A cluster of one or more block groups or census blocks each of which has a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile at the time\n- Surrounding block groups and census blocks each of which has a population density of at least 500 people per square mile at the time, and\n- Less densely settled blocks that form enclaves or indentations, or are used to connect discontiguous areas with qualifying densities.\n\nRural consists of all territory, population, and housing units located outside of UAs and UCs. For Census 2000 this urban and rural classification applies to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.\n\nUrbanized Areas (UAs)\nAn urbanized area consists of densely settled territory that contains 50,000 or more people. The U.S. Census Bureau delineates UAs to provide a better separation of urban and rural territory, population, and housing in the vicinity of large places. For Census 2000, the UA criteria were extensively revised and the delineations were performed using a zero-based approach. Because of more stringent density requirements, some territory that was classified as urbanized for the 1990 census has been reclassified as rural. (Area that was part of a 1990 UA has not been automatically grandfathered into the 2000 UA.) In addition, some areas that were identified as UAs for the 1990 census have been reclassified as urban clusters.\n\nUrban Clusters (UCs)\nAn urban cluster consists of densely settled territory that has at least 2,500 people but fewer than 50,000 people. The U.S. Census Bureau introduced the UC for Census 2000 to provide a more consistent and accurate measure of the population concentration in and around places. UCs are defined using the same criteria that are used to define UAs. UCs replace the provision in the 1990 and previous censuses that defined as urban only those places with 2,500 or more people located outside of urbanized areas.\n\nUrban Area Title and Code\nThe title of each UA and UC may contain up to three incorporated place names, and will include the two-letter U.S. Postal Service abbreviation for each state into which the UA or UC extends. However, if the UA or UC does not contain an incorporated place, the urban area title will include the single name of a census designated place (CDP), minor civil division, or populated place recognized by the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System. Each UC and UA is assigned a 5-digit numeric code, based on a national alphabetical sequence of all urban area names. For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned as four-digit UA code based on the metropolitan area codes. \n\nUrban Area Central Places\nA central place functions as the dominant center of an urban area. The U.S. Census Bureau identifies one or more central places for each UA or UC that contains a place. Any incorporated place or census designated place (CDP) that is in the title of the urban area is a central place of that UA or UC. In addition, any other incorporated place or CDP that has an urban population of 50,000 or an urban\npopulation of at least 2,500 people and is at least 2/3 the size of the largest place within the urban area also is a central place.\n\nExtended Places\nAs a result of the UA and UC delineations, an incorporated place or census designated place (CDP) may be partially within and partially outside of a UA or UC. Any place that is split by a UA or UC is referred to as an extended place.\n\n1990 Urban/Rural \nThe U.S. Census Bureau defined urban for the 1990 census as consisting of all territory and population in urbanized areas (UAs) and in the urban portion of places with 2,500 or more people located outside of the UAs. The 1990 urban and rural classification applied to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n\n1990 Urbanized Areas \nA 1990 urbanized area (UA) consisted of at least one central place and the adjacent densely settled surrounding territory that together had a minimum population of 50,000 people. The densely settled surrounding territory generally consisted of an area with continuous residential development and a general overall population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile.\n\n1990 Extended Cities \nFor the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau distinguished the urban and rural population within incorporated places whose boundaries contained large, sparsely populated, or even unpopulated area. Under the 1990 criteria, an extended city had to contain either 25 percent of the total land area or at least 25 square miles with an overall population density lower than 100 people per square mile. Such pieces of territory had to cover at least 5 square miles. This low-density area was classified as rural and the other, more densely settled portion of the incorporated place was classified as urban. Unlike previous censuses where the U.S. Census Bureau defined extended cities only within UAs, for the 1990 census the U.S. Census Bureau applied the extended city criteria to qualifying incorporated places located outside UAs.\n\n1990 Urbanized Area Codes \nEach 1990 UA was assigned a 4-digit numeric census code in alphabetical sequence on a nationwide basis based on the metropolitan area codes. Note that in Record Type C, the 1990 UA 4-digit numeric census code and Census 2000 UA 5-digit numeric census code share a 5-character field. Because of this, the 1990 4-digit UA code, in Record Type C only, appears with a trailing blank.",

Census county divisions (CCDs) are county subdivisions that were delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with state and local government officials for data presentation purposes.

CCDs have no legal functions and are not governmental units. The boundaries of CCDs usually are delineated to follow visible features and coincide with census tracts where applicable. (In a few instances, two CCDs may constitute a single census tract.) The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location.\n\nMinor civil divisions (MCDs) are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states (parish in Louisiana). MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. \nNOTE: The U.S. Census Bureau does not recognize MCDs for the state of Alabama.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays polygon landmark features throughout the state. \"Landmark\" is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location (KGL). A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.\nThe predominant feature classes represented in this layer include airports or airfields, cemeteries, fraternities or sororities, state or local parks or forests, golf courses, lookout towers, educational and religious institutions.  Other possible landmark features could include military installations, multi-household or transient quarters, custodial facilities, other types of transportation facilities or terminals, employment centers, open space and other special landmark designations for post offices, police stations and firehouses.\n\nThe Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration.\n\nA census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category.\n\nLandmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location.",

VMAP data set products use the \"vector product format\" (vpf). The term \"VMap\" is derived from \"Vector Smart Map.\"\n\nDigital Chart of the World is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data. The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features.\n\nThe coverage is  is organized into 10 thematic layers which feature a vast number of files organized into libraries. These libraries, or coverages, are geographicially bounded areas, rather than feature-linked coverages.  \n\nDCW Layers in the Harvard Geospatial Library are feature-based as we have processed the multiple tiles from the VMAP0 libraries into a series of seamless coverages (e.g. aeronautical features appear in a single layer, \"Aeronautical Facilities, Points\") which depict a particular feature as it occurs throughout the available geographic coverage areas.  Since different geographic areas were mapped by NIMA at different times using various types of feature capture and scanning and digitizing methods and software, multiple map sources of varying dates and multiple processing approaches are represented in each of these HGL layers. We have necessarily generalized the discussion of data source material and process steps in the Data Quality section of this metadata document.",

CCDs have no legal functions and are not governmental units. The boundaries of CCDs usually are delineated to follow visible features and coincide with census tracts where applicable. (In a few instances, two CCDs may constitute a single census tract.) The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location.\n\nMinor civil divisions (MCDs) are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states (parish in Louisiana). MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. \nNOTE: The U.S. Census Bureau has established MCDs for Massachusetts.\nThe MCDs in Massachusetts also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays the secondary school districts throughout the state. \nSchool districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials or the Department of Defense provide public educational services for the areas residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in conjunction with the 1970 census. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name.\n\nThe program identified three possible levels of school districts representing different segments of the school-age population (elementary, intermediate, and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represented all grade levels. The elementary, intermediate, and secondary levels of a school district may overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, an intermediate school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The 1995 TIGER files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels.\n\nThe 1995 TIGER files contain a unified school district code for those school districts where all levels are represented in a single district. The elementary, intermediate, and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code.\n\nSchool districts may cut through existing census blocks. In such instances, the Census Bureau created new complete chains and GT polygons. However, the school district boundaries did not create new blocks. The tabulation blocks may contain more than one polygon, and each polygon may have a different school district code. The block parts/polygons allocated to the different school districts do not have separate tabulation block numbers. Thus, a school district in the TIGER files is a representation of the area, not the actual area. The 1995 TIGER files store the school district codes in a set of four, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 9999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district. Some large water areas have a pseudo-school district code of 99998.",

Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs).\n\nCensus tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.

However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. \nCensus tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled.

Census County Divisions (CCDs) are county subdivisions that were delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with state and local government officials for data presentation purposes. CCDs have been established in 21 states where there are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs), where the MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes, where the boundaries of the MCDs are ambiguous or change frequently, and/or where the MCDs generally are not known to the public. CCDs have no legal functions and are not governmental units. The boundaries of CCDs usually are delineated to follow visible features and coincide with census tracts where applicable. (In a few instances, two CCDs may constitute a single census tract.) The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location.\n\nMinor Civil Divisions (MCDs) are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states (parish in Louisiana). MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. \nNOTE: The U.S. Census Bureau has established MCDs for New Hampshire.\nThe MCDs in New Hampshire also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places.",

Series source sheets are of varying revision dates (1973-2001) and editions, published by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency/U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency (later the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). Some sheets published by the UK Ministry of Defence (later the Defence Geographic and Imagery Intelligence Agency).\n\nThe source map was scanned and georeferenced for Harvard University's Center for Geographic Analysis' AfricaMap project by East View Cartographic. Individual TPC sheets covering a large portion of Africa (137 sheets in total) were selected from the worldwide TPC series.  \n\nThe Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC) is the standard worldwide medium-scale aeronautical chart series. The TPC and other aeronautical navigation and planning charts provide essential cartographic data appropriate to scale, and are overprinted with stable aeronautical information such as obstructions, aerodromes, special use airspace, navigational aids, Maximum Elevation Figures (MEFs), and related data. \n\nTPC's also show selected topographic, cultural and hydrographic features such as: city outlines, towns and villages, rivers, lakes, landmark features (labeled), roads, railroads, towers, transmission lines, other landmarks, vegetation areas, clearings, and more. Ground elevation is indicated by contours (500-foot intervals with intermediate contours shown at 250 feet), shading, tints, and spot heights.\n\nPlease pay close attention to map collar information for original projection information, keys and legends to grid and chart numbering and other numbers, elevations, aeronautical information, vertical obstacles, ground cover, cultural features, and other data which appear inside the neatline.",

The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map.\n\nThe source paper map was produced by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with Massachusetts Department of Public Works.  It was compiled by photogrammetric methods from aerial photographs taken 1980.  Field checked 1981.  Map edited 1987. \n\nThe names of quadrangles which border this one appear in a table on the map collar in their respective positions (N,S,E,W) in relation to this map.",

Each VTD is identified by a 1- to 6-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county.  For the 2010 Census, Rhode Island is the only State that did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs exist for this State in the 2010 Census data products.

Each source map in the series is printed in color at a scale of 1:250,000. \n\nThe source map was selected and downloaded from the University of Texas Libraries Web site by the Harvard University Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) and georeferenced for the CGA's AfricaMap project by East View Cartographic. Individual AMS sheets covering a small portion of Africa (146 sheets in total) were selected from AMS series of: North Africa (P502), West Africa (G504), and South Africa (Z501).\n\nAMS Series maps are typical topographic maps portraying both natural and manmade features. They show and name works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc.  They also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc.  Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 50 meters, with some sheets having supplemental meter contours, form lines, hachures, shading, and/or spot heights. Depths shown by bathymetric isolines.\n\nPlease pay close attention to map collar information on projections, spheroid, planimetric revision methods and dates, and keys to grid numbering and other numbers which appear inside the neatline.",
