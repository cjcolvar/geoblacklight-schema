The associated database contains relevant information about each parcel, including ownership, level of protection, public accessibility, assessor's map and lot numbers, and related legal interests held on the land, including conservation restrictions. Conservation and outdoor recreation facilities owned by federal, state, county, municipal, and nonprofit enterprises are included in this datalayer. Privately owned lands with deeded restrictions are also included, as are lands in the Chapter 61 program. This datalayer can also be linked, through related tables available at http://www.state.ma.us/mgis/osp.htm, with the 1988 Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP) inventory, with facilities and activities data for recreation sites.  The datalayer is paneled into 351 town coverages and significant updates are ongoing. This update effort, coordinated by MassGIS, uses volunteers from state environmental agencies, regional planning commissions, local watershed associations, town conservation commissions, municipal planning and engineering departments, local and regional nonprofits, and open space plan committees. Although the initial data collection effort for this data layer has been completed, open space changes continually and this data layer is therefore considered to be under development. Additionally, due to the collaborative nature of this data collection effort, the accuracy and completeness of open space data varies across the state's municipalities. Attributes, while comprehensive in scope, may be incomplete for many parcels. An evaluation of the accuracy and completeness of open space data for each municipality can be found in the INFO file OS_STATU distributed with open space data. For more information or to obtain the current status of a municipality, please call (617) 626-1076. The following types of land are included in this datalayer: conservation land - habitat protection with minimal recreation, such as walking trails  recreation land -  outdoor facilities such as town parks, commons, playing fields, school fields, golf courses, bike paths, scout camps, and fish and game clubs.  These may be privately or publicly owned facilities.  town forests  parkways - green buffers along roads, if they are a recognized conservation resource  agricultural land - land protected under an Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) and administered by the state Department of Food and Agriculture (DFA)  aquifer protection land  -  not zoning overlay districts  watershed protection land - not zoning overlay districts  cemeteries - if they are a recognized conservation or recreation resource ",

Please refer to the particular metadata for more information on each of the other LandPro Layers.LandPro01 was created by on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing of ortho-rectified aerial photography at a scale of 1:14,000.  The primary source for this GIS database was 2001 true color imagery with one-meter pixel resolution, provided by Aerials Express, Inc.  LandPro2001 was the first update of ARC's baseline landuse/landcover database, LandPro99, which was originally created from 1999 true color imagery with four-foot pixel resolution and 1999 color infrared (CIR) digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs) with one-meter pixel resolution, provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  For more information on the LandPro databases compiled by ARC's GIS Division, refer to the complete documentation, \"LandPro Database\" in the Metadata folder.Attributes:\tLC\tLand Cover Code (use LandPro.avl in GIS_Data folder)LU\tLand Use Code (use LandPro.avl in GIS_Data folder)DE5\tDRAM/EMPAL five categories uses as modeling input DE3\tDRAM/EMPAL three categories used as modeling inputLC_NAME\tLand Cover NameLU_NAME\tLand Use NameLCLU\tLandcover/Landuse Code (concatenation of LC and LU)ACRES\tPolygon area in acres",

States participating in the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) may provide the U.S. Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for VTDs in the 1980 census.\nEach VTD is identified by a 1- to 6-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county. The code \"ZZZZZZ\" identifies bodies of water for which no VTDs were identified. For a state or county that did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, the codes fields are blank. Because the U.S. Census Bureau requires that VTDs follow boundaries of tabulation census blocks, participating states often show the boundaries of the VTDs they submit as conforming to tabulation census block boundaries. If requested by the participating state, the U.S. Census Bureau identifies the VTDs that represent an actual voting district with a Place Description Code of X. Where a participating state indicated that the VTD is a \"pseudo\" VTD, the Place Description Code is Z. Where a participating state did not indicate to the U.S. Census Bureau whether or not the VTD followed the actual boundaries of the VTD or is a pseudo-VTD the Place Description Code is blank.\nThe following states did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs appear for these states: California; Florida; Kentucky; and Montana\nOf the participating states (or statistically equivalent entities), the following did not submit VTD boundaries or codes as part of Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, but submitted State Legislative Districts (SLDs) only: North; Dakota; Ohio; Oregon; Wisconsin, and Arizona: did not submit VTDs in all counties.",

School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, tribal, or local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files contain school district information from the 1999-2000 school year.\n\nThe UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files identify three levels of school districts representing different grade ranges of the school-age population (elementary and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represent all grade levels. The elementary and secondary levels of a school district can overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, a secondary school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The TIGER/Line files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files contain a Unified School District code for those school districts where all grade levels are represented in a single district. The elementary and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code. An exception exists for the State of Hawaii and the five boroughs of New York city where the National School District Program requested that the U.S. Census Bureau include the School Complex Areas in Hawaii and the Community School Districts in New York city. In Massachusetts. South Carolina, and Tennessee some unified school districts also serve as secondary school districts in areas where there are elementary school districts. In these situations, the U.S. Census Bureau could not use the same school district code to identify school districts serving different grade ranges and has assigned two separate codes; a unified school district code and a separate \"false\" secondary school district code. Data users can identify the \"false\" school districts by looking for \"false\" as part of the school district name appearing in Record Type C. A few additional exceptions occur where the Department of Defense operates elementary schools within a unified school district.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files store the school district codes in a set of three, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 99999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district. Some large water areas have a pseudo-school district code of 99998.",

The term, rail line in center, indicates that a rail line shares the road right-of-way. The rail line may follow the center of the road or be directly next to the road; representation is dependent upon the available source used during the update. The rail line can represent a railroad, a streetcar line, or other carline. Road types possibly represented here are defined as follows:\n\n-Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.\n-Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics.\n-Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways.\n-Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads.\n-Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in this category.\n-Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics.\n-Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.",

CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions.

After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of electing representatives. Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable. \n\nThe congressional districts for the 103rd Congress (January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. The 103rd Congressional Districts will remain in effect through Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting required a change. Six states redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), five states redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states (New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. \n\nIn North Carolina the \"1998 Congressional Plan A\" was used for the 1998 congressional elections. It was created in response to a court ruling which held the 1997 plan, \"97 House/Senate Plan A,\" unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has since reversed that lower court ruling and was used for the 2000 North Carolina congressional elections. The 106th Congressional Districts appearing in the UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files for North Carolina are the \"97 House/Senate Plan A\" Congressional Districts. The 108th Congress will be the first to reflect reapportionment and redistricting based on Census 2000 data. Congressional districts are identified by a 2-character numeric FIPS code.\n\nThe UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files contain fields for the current (106th ), the 106th, and the 108th Congressional Districts. Congressional districts are numbered uniquely within state. The field for the 108th Congressional Districts is blank.

If place names are duplicated within a state, and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by primary county in which each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, alphabetically by their legal description (for example, ''city'' before ''village'').\n\nStatistical entities which may be represented in this datalayer include:\n\nCensus Designated Place (CDP).\nCensus designated places (CDPs) are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.\n\nConsolidated City. \nAn incorporated place that has combined its governmental functions with a county or subcounty entity but contains one or more other incorporated places that continue to function as local governments within the consolidated government.\n\nIncorporated Place.\nA type of governmental unit, incorporated under state law as a city, town (except in New England, New York, and  Wisconsin), borough (except in Alaska and New York), or village, having legally prescribed limits, powers, and functions.",

The term, rail line in center, indicates that a rail line shares the road right-of-way. The rail line may follow the center of the road or be directly next to the road; representation is dependent upon the available source used during the update. The rail line can represent a railroad, a streetcar line, or other carline. Road types possibly represented here are defined as follows:\n\n-Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.\n-Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics.\n-Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways.\n-Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads.\n-Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in this category.\n-Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics.\n-Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.",

             "dc_description_s" => "This datalayer depicts feature location and other associated data for American Indian tribal entities for those entities established on January 1, 2000. American Indian Reservations are areas that have been set aside by the United States for the use of tribes, the exterior boundaries of which are more particularly defined in the final tribal treaties, agreements, executive orders, federal statutes, secretarial orders, or judicial determinations.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau recognizes federal reservations as territory over which American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority. These entities are known as colonies, communities, pueblos, rancherias, ranches, reservations, reserves, villages, Indian communities, and Indian villages. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) maintains a list of federally recognized tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau contacts representatives of American Indian tribal governments to identify the boundaries for federal reservations. Federal reservations may cross state, county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. The BIA supplied the U.S. Census Bureau with the names and exterior boundaries of the federal AIRs used for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for American Indian reservations in the 1970 census. The range of Census Codes allocated to Federal AIRs for the year 2000 data is 0001 to 4999.\nThere are both legal and statistical American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides data. The legal entities consist of federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, the tribal subdivisions that can divide these entities, state recognized American Indian reservations, Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs), and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs). Tribal subdivisions can exist within the statistical Oklahoma tribal statistical areas.\nIn all cases, these areas are mutually exclusive in that no American Indian, Alaska Native, or Hawaiian home land can overlap another tribal entity, except for tribal subdivisions, which subdivide some American Indian entities, and Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), which exist within Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs). \n\nAmerican Indian Trust Lands\nAreas for which the United States holds title in trust for the benefit of a tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual Indian (individual trust land). Trust lands can be alienated or encumbered only by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his/her authorized representative. Trust lands may be located on or off a reservation. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data for reservations and off-reservation trust lands because American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority over these lands. Primary tribal governmental authority generally is not attached to tribal lands located off the reservation until the lands are placed in trust. In U.S. Census Bureau data tabulations, off-reservation trust lands always are associated with a specific federally recognized reservation and/or tribal government. A tribal government appointed liaison provides the name and boundaries of their trust lands. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), an agency in the U.S. Department of the Interior, identified and provided maps of these areas for use by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for off-reservation tribal trust lands in the 1980 census; in 1990, the trust land data included both tribal and individual trust lands. The U.S. Census Bureau does not identify fee land (or land in fee simple status) or restricted fee lands as specific geographic categories and they are not identified in the TIGER/Line files. Trust lands are assigned the same code as the reservation with which they are associated. Trust lands associated with tribes that do not have a reservation are assigned codes based on tribal name. In the TIGER/Line files, a letter code-\"T\" for tribal and \"I\" for individual-appears in a separate field and identifies off-reservation trust lands.\n\nAmerican Indian Reservations-State (State AIRs) \nReservations established by some state governments for tribes recognized by the state. A governor-appointed state liaison provides the names and boundaries for state recognized American Indian reservations to the U.S. Census Bureau. State reservations may cross county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. The range of Census Class Codes allocated to State AIRs for the year 2000 data is 9000 to 9499.\n\nAmerican Indian Tribal Subdivisions\nAdministrative subdivisions of federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust land, or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs). Tribal subdivisions are known as areas, chapters, communities, or districts. These entities are internal units of self-government or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for the American Indians on the reservations, off-reservation trust lands, or OTSAs. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundary and name information for tribal subdivisions from tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in 1980 when it identified them as \"American Indian sub-reservation areas.\" The U.S. Census Bureau did not provide data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in conjunction with the 1990 census.\n\nJoint Use Areas\nAs applied to any American Indian area/Alaska Native area by the U.S. Census Bureau, means an area that is administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The U.S. Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data.\n\nState Designated American Indian Statistical Areas (SDAISAs)\nStatistical entities for state recognized American Indian tribes that do not have a state recognized land base (reservation). SDAISAs are identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by a state liaison identified by the governor's office in each state. SDAISAs generally encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of people who identify with a state recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A SDAISA may not be located in more than one state unless the tribe is recognized by both states, and it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), tribal designated statistical area (TDSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau established SDAISAs as a new geographic statistical area for Census 2000 to differentiate between state recognized tribes without a land base and federally recognized tribes without a land base. For the 1990 census, all such tribal entities had been identified as TDSAs. The range of Census Class Codes allocated to SDAISAs for the year 2000 data is 9500 to 9998.\n\nTribal Designated Statistical Areas (TDSAs)\nStatistical entities identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by federally recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have a federally recognized land base (reservation or off-reservation trust land). A TDSA generally encompasses a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with a federally recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A TDSA may be located in more than one state, but it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for TDSAs in conjunction with the 1990 census, when both federally and state recognized tribes could identify and delineate TDSAs. For Census 2000, TDSAs now apply only to federally recognized tribes. State recognized tribes without a land base, including those that were TDSAs in 1990, are identified as state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs), a new geographic entity for Census 2000. The range of Census Class Codes allocated to TDSAs for the year 2000 data is 8000 to 8999.\n\nTribal Jurisdiction Statistical Areas (TJSAs)\n1990 statistical entities identified and delineated for the 1990 census to provide a geographic frame of reference for the presentation of statistical data. 1990 TJSA boundaries were required to follow census block boundaries and were based upon the boundaries of the former reservations of federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma. TJSAs replaced the Historic Areas of Oklahoma recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1980 decennial census. The 1990 descriptive designation, TJSA, has been changed for Census 2000 to Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs).",

Block Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract having the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number.  For example, block group 3 (BG 3) within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from 3000 to 3999. \n\nCensus 2000 BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the U.S. Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant.\n\nA BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urbanized areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian/Alaska Native areas/Hawaiian home lands. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian homeland census geographic hierarchy, census tracts and BGs are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as Tribal BGs.\n\nBGs have a valid range of 0 through 9. BGs beginning with a 0 generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three mile territorial sea limit, the U.S. Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The U.S. Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0000 and BG of 0 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.\n\nIn decennial census data tabulations, a block group may be split to present data for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, voting district, congressional district, American Indian area/Alaska Native area/ Hawaiian home land shown in the data tabulation products.",

             "dc_description_s" => "This datalayer depicts feature location and other associated data for American Indian tribal entities for those entities established on January 1, 1990. American Indian Reservations are areas that have been set aside by the United States for the use of tribes, the exterior boundaries of which are more particularly defined in the final tribal treaties, agreements, executive orders, federal statutes, secretarial orders, or judicial determinations. The Census Class Code range associated with American Indian Reservations is 0001 to 4989 for the 1990 datalayer.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau recognizes federal reservations as territory over which American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority. These entities are known as colonies, communities, pueblos, rancherias, ranches, reservations, reserves, villages, Indian communities, and Indian villages. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) maintains a list of federally recognized tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau contacts representatives of American Indian tribal governments to identify the boundaries for federal reservations. Federal reservations may cross state, county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. The BIA supplied the U.S. Census Bureau with the names and exterior boundaries of the federal AIRs used for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for American Indian reservations in the 1970 census.\nThere are both legal and statistical American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides data. The legal entities consist of federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, the tribal subdivisions that can divide these entities, state recognized American Indian reservations, Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs), and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs). Tribal subdivisions can exist within the statistical Oklahoma tribal statistical areas. In all cases, these areas are mutually exclusive in that no American Indian, Alaska Native, or Hawaiian home land can overlap another tribal entity, except for tribal subdivisions, which subdivide some American Indian entities, and Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), which exist within Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs). \n\nAmerican Indian Trust Lands\nAreas for which the United States holds title in trust for the benefit of a tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual Indian (individual trust land). Trust lands can be alienated or encumbered only by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his/her authorized representative. Trust lands may be located on or off a reservation. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data for reservations and off-reservation trust lands because American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority over these lands. Primary tribal governmental authority generally is not attached to tribal lands located off the reservation until the lands are placed in trust. In U.S. Census Bureau data tabulations, off-reservation trust lands always are associated with a specific federally recognized reservation and/or tribal government. A tribal government appointed liaison provides the name and boundaries of their trust lands. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), an agency in the U.S. Department of the Interior, identified and provided maps of these areas for use by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for off-reservation tribal trust lands in the 1980 census; in 1990, the trust land data included both tribal and individual trust lands. The U.S. Census Bureau does not identify fee land (or land in fee simple status) or restricted fee lands as specific geographic categories and they are not identified in the TIGER/Line files. Trust lands are assigned the same code as the reservation with which they are associated. Trust lands associated with tribes that do not have a reservation are assigned codes based on tribal name. In the TIGER/Line files, a letter code-\"T\" for tribal and \"I\" for individual-appears in a separate field and identifies off-reservation trust lands.\n\nAmerican Indian Reservations-State (State AIRs) \nReservations established by some state governments for tribes recognized by the state. A governor-appointed state liaison provides the names and boundaries for state recognized American Indian reservations to the U.S. Census Bureau. State reservations may cross county, county subdivision, and place boundaries.\n\nAmerican Indian Tribal Subdivisions\nAdministrative subdivisions of federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust land, or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs). Tribal subdivisions are known as areas, chapters, communities, or districts. These entities are internal units of self-government or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for the American Indians on the reservations, off-reservation trust lands, or OTSAs. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundary and name information for tribal subdivisions from tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in 1980 when it identified them as \"American Indian sub-reservation areas.\" The U.S. Census Bureau did not provide data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in conjunction with the 1990 census.\n\nJoint Use Areas\nAs applied to any American Indian area/Alaska Native area by the U.S. Census Bureau, means an area that is administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The U.S. Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data.\n\nTribal Designated Statistical Areas (TDSAs)\nStatistical entities identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by federally recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have a federally recognized land base (reservation or off-reservation trust land). A TDSA generally encompasses a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with a federally recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. TDSAs are associated with Census Class Codes of 000 to 9989 for the 1990 datalayer.  A TDSA may be located in more than one state, but it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for TDSAs in conjunction with the 1990 census, when both federally and state recognized tribes could identify and delineate TDSAs. For Census 2000, TDSAs now apply only to federally recognized tribes. State recognized tribes without a land base, including those that were TDSAs in 1990, are identified as state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs), a new geographic entity for Census 2000. \n\nTribal Jurisdiction Statistical Areas (TJSAs)\n1990 statistical entities identified and delineated for the 1990 census to provide a geographic frame of reference for the presentation of statistical data. 1990 TJSA boundaries were required to follow census block boundaries and were based upon the boundaries of the former reservations of federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma. The range of Census Class Codes associated with TJSAs is 5000 to 5989. TJSAs replaced the Historic Areas of Oklahoma recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1980 decennial census. The 1990 descriptive designation, TJSA, has been changed for Census 2000 to Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs).",

The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in conjunction with the 1970 census. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name.\n\nThe program identified three possible levels of school districts representing different segments of the school-age population (elementary, intermediate, and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represented all grade levels. The elementary, intermediate, and secondary levels of a school district may overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, an intermediate school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The 1995 TIGER files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels.\n\nThe 1995 TIGER files contain a unified school district code for those school districts where all levels are represented in a single district. The elementary, intermediate, and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code.\n\nSchool districts may cut through existing census blocks. In such instances, the Census Bureau created new complete chains and GT polygons. However, the school district boundaries did not create new blocks. The tabulation blocks may contain more than one polygon, and each polygon may have a different school district code. The block parts/polygons allocated to the different school districts do not have separate tabulation block numbers. Thus, a school district in the TIGER files is a representation of the area, not the actual area. The 1995 TIGER files store the school district codes in a set of four, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 9999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district. Some large water areas have a pseudo-school district code of 99998.",

The data are reprojected mosaic exports from NASA TERRA/MODIS HDF-EOS MOD12Q1 V004 products.  This version of the data is in the Plate Carr???e projection at 30 Arc-second resolution. [CAVEAT: Plate Carr???e  is not an Equal Area Projection.]  The original MODIS data was reprojected and repackaged as 8-bit binary files by Boston University's Department of Geography.  The binary file was then converted to an ESRI Grid file by the Harvard Geospatial Library team.\n\nThe Land Cover Classification product, MOD12Q1, identifies 17 classes of land cover in the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) global vegetation classification scheme. This scheme includes 11 natural vegetation classes, 3 developed land classes, one of which is a mosaic with natural vegetation, permanent snow or ice, barren or sparsely vegetated, and water. Additional Science Data Set layers for other classification schemes include the University of Maryland modification of the IGBP scheme, the MODIS LAI/fPAR (MOD15) scheme, and the MODIS Net Primary Production (MOD17) scheme. These classes are distinguished with a supervised decision tree classification method. The MOD12 classification schemes are multitemporal classes describing land cover properties as observed during the year (12 months of input data). Successive production of this \"annual\" product allows us to make new land cover maps with increasing accuracies as both classification techniques and the training site database mature. For land cover change, users should use the Vegetation Cover Conversion product, MOD44, or the Land Cover Dynamics product, MOD12Q2.",

Block Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract having the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number.  For example, block group 3 (BG 3) within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from 3000 to 3999. \n\nCensus 2000 BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the U.S. Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant.\n\nA BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urbanized areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian/Alaska Native areas/Hawaiian home lands. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian homeland census geographic hierarchy, census tracts and BGs are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as Tribal BGs.\n\nBGs have a valid range of 0 through 9. BGs beginning with a 0 generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three mile territorial sea limit, the U.S. Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The U.S. Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0000 and BG of 0 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.\n\nIn decennial census data tabulations, a block group may be split to present data for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, voting district, congressional district, American Indian area/Alaska Native area/ Hawaiian home land shown in the data tabulation products.",

Train cars and engines are repaired, switched, and dispatched from a yard.\nRailroads with special characteristics, or railroads or portions of a railroad track that are parts of the railroad system and have separately identifiable characteristics such as ferry crossings, carlines, a track for street cars, trolleys and other special types.

A Block Group (BG) is a cluster of census blocks having the same first digit of their four-digit identifying numbers within a census tract.

BGs on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 300 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, worker's dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) \n\nMost BGs were delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local, state, or tribal government declined to participate or where the U.S. Census Bureau could not identify a potential local or tribal participant. BGs never cross the boundaries of states, counties, or statistically equivalent entities, except for a BG delineated by American Indian tribal authorities, and then only when tabulated within the American Indian hierarchy. BGs never cross the boundaries of census tracts, but may cross the boundary of any other geographic entity required as a census block boundary.",

CCDs have no legal functions and are not governmental units. The boundaries of CCDs usually are delineated to follow visible features and coincide with census tracts where applicable. (In a few instances, two CCDs may constitute a single census tract.) The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location.\n\nMinor civil divisions (MCDs) are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states (parish in Louisiana). MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. \nNOTE: The U.S. Census Bureau has established MCDs for Vermont.\nThe MCDs in Vermont also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places.",

             "dc_description_s" => "This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the state. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs).\n\nCensus tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement, delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. \nCensus tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties (see TRIBAL CENSUS TRACTS). The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",

Essential attribute data included here are KGL Name and Census Feature Class Code (CFCC). Predominant features represented in this layer have CFCCs of: D21 (Apartment building or complex); D23 (Trailer court or mobile home park); D51 (Airport or airfield); D61 (Shopping center or major retail center).\n\nPlease note that many other feature types may be present in this layer. Key geographic locations (KGLs) represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty.\n\nThe Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration.\n\n A landmark can be a point, line, or area type. In some cases, the Census TIGER data base permits a choice of types. For instance, an airport or airfield might appear as a point, line, or area; the approach depends on the size of the feature and the depiction of the feature in the source document. Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types\n\nA census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category.\n\nLandmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location. A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.",

Since different geographic areas were mapped by NIMA at different times using various types of feature capture and scanning and digitizing methods and software, multiple map sources of varying dates and multiple processing approaches are represented in each of these HGL layers.

Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) are metropolitan areas (MAs) that are not closely associated with other MAs. These areas typically are surrounded by non-metropolitan counties. Statistical entities which share some relation to the MSA include:\n\nConsolidated and Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA and PMSA).\nIf an area that qualifies as a metropolitan area (MA) has 1 million people or more, two or more primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) may be defined within it. Each PMSA consists of a large urbanized county or cluster of counties that demonstrate very strong internal economic and social links, in addition to close ties to other portions of the larger area. When PMSAs are established, the larger MA of which they are component parts is designated a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA). CMSAs and PMSAs are established only where local governments favor such designations for a large MA.\n\nMetropolitan Area (MA).\nThe general concept of a metropolitan area (MA) is one of a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Some MAs are defined around two or more nuclei. The MAs and the central cities within an MA are designated and defined by the Federal Office of Management and Budget, following a set of official standards that are published in a Federal Register Notice. These standards were developed by the interagency Federal Executive Committee on Metropolitan Areas, with the aim of producing definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MAs nationwide. Each MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of 50,000 or a U.S. Census Bureau-defined urbanized area and a total MA population of at least 100,000.  An MA contains one or more central counties. An MA also may include one or more outlying counties that have close economic and social relationships with the central county.\n\nCentral City.\nIn each metropolitan statistical area and consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the largest place and, in some cases, one or more additional places are designated as ''central cities'' under the official standards. A few primary metropolitan statistical areas do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities, are included in the title of the metropolitan area (MA); there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that place that extends outside the MA boundary.",

Edition: 1. Revision date: 1983. Printed in: 1988. Covers all or portions of: Madagascar.\n\nThe image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to World Geodetic System (1984) coordinates. All map collar information is also available as part of the raster image. Series source sheets are of varying revision dates (1973-2001) and editions, published by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency/U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency (later the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). Some sheets published by the UK Ministry of Defence (later the Defence Geographic and Imagery Intelligence Agency).\n\nThe source map was scanned and georeferenced for Harvard University's Center for Geographic Analysis' AfricaMap project by East View Cartographic. Individual TPC sheets covering a large portion of Africa (137 sheets in total) were selected from the worldwide TPC series.  \n\nThe Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC) is the standard worldwide medium-scale aeronautical chart series. The TPC and other aeronautical navigation and planning charts provide essential cartographic data appropriate to scale, and are overprinted with stable aeronautical information such as obstructions, aerodromes, special use airspace, navigational aids, Maximum Elevation Figures (MEFs), and related data. \n\nTPC's also show selected topographic, cultural and hydrographic features such as: city outlines, towns and villages, rivers, lakes, landmark features (labeled), roads, railroads, towers, transmission lines, other landmarks, vegetation areas, clearings, and more. Ground elevation is indicated by contours (500-foot intervals with intermediate contours shown at 250 feet), shading, tints, and spot heights.\n\nPlease pay close attention to map collar information for original projection information, keys and legends to grid and chart numbering and other numbers, elevations, aeronautical information, vertical obstacles, ground cover, cultural features, and other data which appear inside the neatline.",

This information is used by Federal, State, and local agencies, academic institutions, U.S. Congress, and the private sector.  The Emergency Wetland Resources Act of 1986 directs the Service to map the wetlands of the United States. The NWI has mapped 89% of the lower 48 states, and 31% of Alaska. The Act also requires the Service to produce a digital wetlands database for the United States. About 39% of the lower 48 states and 11% of Alaska are digitized.  Approximately 50 percent of Massachusetts is available in digital format. For full details on the national mapping project visit the National Wetlands Inventory web site: http://www.fws.gov/nwi/",

States participating in the 2010 Census Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) provided the Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs.  Each VTD is identified by a 1- to 6-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county.  For the 2010 Census, Rhode Island is the only State that did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs exist for this State in the 2010 Census data products.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Voting district is the generic name for geographic entities such as precincts, wards, and election districts established by State governments for the purpose of conducting elections.  States participating in the 2010 Census Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) provided the Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs.  Each VTD is identified by a 1- to 6-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county.  For the 2010 Census, Rhode Island is the only State that did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs exist for this State in the 2010 Census data products.

The core habitats delineated for three tern species (Common, Least, and Arctic, which are state-listed as species of special concern) include documented breeding, staging (presence of 100 or more pairs), and foraging areas. The breeding and staging sites were identified and mapped by DFW/NHESP biologists and buffered 0.3 nautical miles. Within the foraging areas, DFW/NHESP biologists identified core foraging areas based upon scientific literature to represent the most important foraging areas, critical to the use of the mapped breeding and staging areas. The breeding, staging, and critical foraging areas were extracted as core habitat.\n\nTo allow for consistent evaluation and comparison of a variety of datasets with distinct spatial resolutions, accuracies, and other characteristics, the Massachusetts ocean management planning area was partitioned into 250 x 250-meter grid cells, each with a unique ID. These data were converted to the planning area grid by extracting all of the cells in which the data layer occurred. The data were then dissolved into one feature.",
